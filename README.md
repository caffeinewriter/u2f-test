### Serverless FIDO U2F test

This allows you to test a FIDO U2F token without a server.  It can also
be used as reference code for a U2F server implementation.

To make it work you have to 1) use a FIDO-U2F enabled browser (as of this
writing that means either Chrome, or Firefox with the U2F extension) and
2) serve these files from an HTTPS URL.

Other than that it should be pretty self-explanatory.
